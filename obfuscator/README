Obfuscator is a data obfuscation cloud client. This directory will used for future development.

Obfuscator cloud client prototype implmented as an extention of the NCCloud tool. 
It is implemented as a new coding scheme in OFMSRCode class in nccloud/codings/ofmsr.cc and nccloud/codings/ofmsr.h (go to ../nccloud/ for details)
Usage of the tool remains the same as in the original NCCloud tool. 
Coding scheme uses the following parameters in config file:
[Coding]
k=2
n=4
t=8
tmpdir=store/tmp
type=3
w=8 
 
Type 3 stands for OFMSRCode (new coding scheme).


Example usage (in bash):
$
cd nccloud-c++-1.0/nccloud
make
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="../libfmsr/lib:../Jerasure/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
cp template/config_local config
